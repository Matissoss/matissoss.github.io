            <h1> My thoughts about Pixel Game Jam 2024: What i did?, What could i do better?</h1>
            <h2 style="color:lightgreen">Hello Everyone!
                Matissoss here!&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Welcome to my first official devlog.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Today i would like to talk about my participation in Pixel Game Jam 2024 organized by SanForge Studio.</h2>
                <h2>&nbsp;I highly recomend to check games made by other jammers.&nbsp;<a href="https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024/entries" target="_blank">Here is link for other submissions for this jam </a>&nbsp;<a href="https://matissoss.itch.io/switcher" target="_blank">and here is for mine</a>.</h2>
                <h2>
                Anyways, lets start my yourney through this game jam. So, the yourney began May 11 2024.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Theme for this jam was <a style="color:aqua">Aqua</a>.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>I had two other ideas to choose from, but i decided to choose this one.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Thoughts&nbsp;somehow went like this:&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 style="color:aqua">Aqua -&gt; Color -&gt; Changing Colors -&gt; Player have to switch colors to beat level.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>This idea is also used in game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383270/Hue/" target="_blank"> Hue</a>, which i recommend to check out.</h2>
                <h2>&nbsp;But now, lets start progress from day 1 to end of jam.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2><a style="color:red"> Day 1: </a> i beginned making prototype. I also did music and sfx for game this day, mostly from older projects/music i didn't use. Its all i did for day 1.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red"> Day 2: </a> i made doors and levers, keys and doors, implemented music and SFX in game and added color pallete to choose colors from.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 3: </a> Day 3 was rather unproductive. I didnt do much because of school. All i did was to make prototype level to show.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 4: </a> was more productive than last one. I made a level for players to play.</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 5: </a> i started to polish my game by upgrading: UI, Color Pallete. I also made new logo/banner for game.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 6: </a> i finally finished my game. This day i made level and fixed/polished small things.</h2>
                <h2 style="color:lightgreen">&nbsp;But, what could i do better?&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>I think i planned game too small for this time. I just felt game i made could be more ambitious, but maybe i did right.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 style="color:powderblue">For all readers, I wish you all Good Day and thanks for reading,</h2>
