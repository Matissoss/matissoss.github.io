            <p style="color:yellow"> Matissoss Here! </p>
            <p> Today i would like to share what i learned after six months of programming/game development</p>
            <p> Well, title has some 'clickbait' in it, because i have more experience, with syntax and some 'experience' with C++ that helped me in learning C#. To be precise, I've been programming since September 2023. </p>
            <p> But enough, let's get back to title of this post. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color:red"> What i learned after six months of game development/programming? </p>
            <p> First thing i learned is preety explainable. It's language C# and Unity with it. I also learnt programming/writing good, clean code (not true). </p>
            <p> Second thing is programming itself. What i meant is that lots of things are a lot easier to program for me. </p>
            <p> Third thing is polishing/making better games. It's easy to think about, but i really meant it. Let's comparise UI from my first game Space Flight and recent game Switcher</p>
            <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE2MjI4NDQyLnBuZw==/original/npUulj.png" width="720" height="480" title="Space Flight UI. As it can be seen, it's not-responsible (you cannot feel you are clicking/hovering it)"></p>
            <p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE2MjI4NDE2LnBuZw==/original/CfQQK1.png" width="720" height="480" title="Switcher UI. As you can see it's responsible."><br></p>
            <p> (Switcher have clearly better UI than Space Flight. Space Flight UI seems pixelated a lot which gives it weird appearance) </p>
            <p>Okay, so let's go with other programming languages.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>First on list is HTML/CSS. Proof can be seen here: &nbsp;<a href="https://matissoss.github.io" target="_blank">https://matissoss.github.io</a>. I just learned front-end of creating websites.</p>
            <p>Second is C. I only made <a href="https://github.com/Matissoss/Rock-Paper-Scrissors-in-C" target="_blank">  Rock Paper Scrissors </a> in it.</p>
            <p>Third is C++ which i mentioned earlier, but i don't have any projects to show.</p>
            <p>I think i mentioned everything. Well, then let's do a shorter recap.</p>
            <p>Last six months were the <a style="color:lightgreen">best</a> i ever had. I learnt a lot, which is good news.</p>
            <p>I hope that next months will be as good or even better.</p>
            <p>Thanks for Reading,</p>

            <h2 style="color:lightgreen">Hello Everyone!
                Matissoss here!&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Welcome to my first official devlog.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Today i would like to talk about my participation in Pixel Game Jam 2024 organized by SanForge Studio.</h2>
                <h2>&nbsp;I highly recomend to check games made by other jammers.&nbsp;<a href="https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024/entries" target="_blank">Here is link for other submissions for this jam </a>&nbsp;<a href="https://matissoss.itch.io/switcher" target="_blank">and here is for mine</a>.</h2>
                <h2>
                Anyways, lets start my yourney through this game jam. So, the yourney began May 11 2024.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Theme for this jam was <a style="color:aqua">Aqua</a>.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>I had two other ideas to choose from, but i decided to choose this one.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>Thoughts&nbsp;somehow went like this:&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 style="color:aqua">Aqua -&gt; Color -&gt; Changing Colors -&gt; Player have to switch colors to beat level.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>This idea is also used in game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383270/Hue/" target="_blank"> Hue</a>, which i recommend to check out.</h2>
                <h2>&nbsp;But now, lets start progress from day 1 to end of jam.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2><a style="color:red"> Day 1: </a> i beginned making prototype. I also did music and sfx for game this day, mostly from older projects/music i didn't use. Its all i did for day 1.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red"> Day 2: </a> i made doors and levers, keys and doors, implemented music and SFX in game and added color pallete to choose colors from.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 3: </a> Day 3 was rather unproductive. I didnt do much because of school. All i did was to make prototype level to show.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 4: </a> was more productive than last one. I made a level for players to play.</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 5: </a> i started to polish my game by upgrading: UI, Color Pallete. I also made new logo/banner for game.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2> <a style="color:red">Day 6: </a> i finally finished my game. This day i made level and fixed/polished small things.</h2>
                <h2 style="color:lightgreen">&nbsp;But, what could i do better?&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2>I think i planned game too small for this time. I just felt game i made could be more ambitious, but maybe i did right.&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 style="color:powderblue">For all readers, I wish you all Good Day and thanks for reading,</h2>
