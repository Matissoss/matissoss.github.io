        Hello Everyone!
        <br>
        Matissoss here!
        <br>
        Welcome to my first official devlog. Today i would like to talk about my participation in Pixel Game Jam 2024 organized by SanForge Studio.
        <br>
        I higly recomend to check games made by other jammers. <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024" target="_blank">Here is link for other submissions for this jam</a>
        <br>
        Anyways, lets start my yourney through this game jam. So, the yourney began May 11 2024. Theme for this jam was Aqua.
        <br>
        I had two other ideas to choose from, but i decided to choose this one.
        <br>
        Thoughts somehow went like this: <br>
        Aqua -> Color -> Changing Colors -> Player have to switch colors to beat level.
        <br>
        This idea is also used in game called Hue, which i recommend to check out. But now, lets start progress from day 1 to end of jam.
        <br>
        On day 1 i beginned making prototype. I also did music and sfx for game this day, mostly from older projects/music i didn't use. Its all i did for day 1.
        <br>
        On day 2 i made doors and levers, keys and doors, implemented music and SFX in game and added color pallete to choose colors from.
        <br>
        Day 3 was rather unproductive. I didnt do much because of school. All i did was to make prototype level to show.
        <br>
        On the other side day 4 was more productive than last one. I made a level for players to play.
        <br>
        On day 5 i started to polish my game by upgrading: UI, Color Pallete. I also made new logo/banner for game.
        <br>
        On day 6 i finally finished my game. This day i made level and fixed/polished small things.
        <br>
        <br>
        But, what could i do better?
        <br>
        I think i planned game too small for this time. I just felt game i made could be more ambitious, but maybe i did right.
        <br>
        For all readers, I wish you all Good Day and thanks for reading,
